## **Linux Text Editors**

A **Linux text editor** is a software application used for creating, editing, and managing text-based files on a Linux system. These editors are essential tools for writing configuration files, editing code, or scripting in the terminal. There are a wide variety of text editors in the Linux ecosystem—each with unique features and interfaces that cater to different user preferences and skill levels.

### **Vim Text Editor**

**Vim (Vi Improved)** is a powerful and highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text manipulation. It is an enhanced version of the original **Vi editor** and is popular among developers, system administrators, and advanced Linux users. Vim has multiple modes (like insert mode and normal mode) and a steep learning curve, but it provides unmatched efficiency once mastered.

#### **Working with Vim Editor**

Here’s how to get started with Vim:

1. **Open a File**  
   To create or open a file, use:  
   ```
   vim exercise.txt
   ```  
   This command opens (or creates, if it doesn’t exist) a file named `exercise.txt`.

2. **Insert Mode**  
   Press `i` to enter **Insert Mode** so you can start typing.

3. **Enter Text**  
   Type the following:  
   ```
   Hello, this is a Vim hands-on project.  
   Welcome to darey.io.
   ```

4. **Navigation**  
   - Use **arrow keys** or:
     - `h` = left  
     - `j` = down  
     - `k` = up  
     - `l` = right  

5. **Deleting Text**
   - **Delete a character**: Press `Esc`, move the cursor to the character, then press `x`.  
   - **Delete a whole line**: Press `Esc`, place the cursor on the line, then press `dd`.

6. **Undoing Changes**  
   Press `Esc`, then type `u` to undo the last change.

7. **Saving and Quitting**  
   - Save and exit: `Esc`, then type `:wq`, press Enter.  
   - Exit without saving: `Esc`, then type `:q!`, press Enter.

### **Nano Text Editor**

#### **Working with Nano Editor**

1. **Open a File**  
   To create or open a file:

   ```

2. **Edit Text**  
   Begin typing directly—no need to enter a separate mode like in Vim.

3. **Save Changes**  
   Press `Ctrl + O` to save. Press **Enter** to confirm the filename.

4. **Exit Nano**  
   Press `Ctrl + X`. If there are unsaved changes, Nano will prompt you to save before exiting.

   Navigate with the arrow keys, edit, and save as needed.
